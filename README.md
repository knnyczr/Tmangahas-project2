# Tmangahas-project2

* Description:
    * This project is a full stack application for keeping track of car parts the user would like to purchase and install.  The application has complete CRUD functionality.  The user can add a new part (create), view the details of existing parts (read), edit the details of the parts (update), and delete parts (delete).
    * I approached this project by thinking of something that I already use.  When researching for car parts, I keep track of the details like part number, price, and links in a spreadsheet.  In the project, I first enabled the CRUD functionality, then slowly added features.
